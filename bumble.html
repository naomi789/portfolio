                in order to understand how women in
                their 20s make friends 1:1 and in group settings and a explore a

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>As an avid Bumble BFF user myself (I met most of my Seattle friends
                  on Bumble BFF!!), I have gotten frustrated before with the mismatch
                  between someone's profile and what they're like in real life.
                  I've found myself wishing there was a way to meet more than one
                  person at once, in small groups of 3-7 people, because it seems to be there will
                  be better odds that I could hit it off with someone - and that other
                  people will hit it off with other people!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  To me, small group settings
                  just feel like a more natural way to get to know people than 1:1
                  settings, which feel reminiscent of a date. But I wasn't sure
                  how other people make friends, and I didn't know what was working
                  and wasn't working for them. Wondering whether other people would be interested in small group
                  meetups, and how that feature might work, I decided to do a personal
                  research project!

                could not have guessed, anticipated or psychically stumbled upon</p>-->
                <p>People make friends through a variety of methods -
                  very intentionally looking to meet people interested in new friendships,
                  being befriended by someone else who seemed very intentional,
                  or "just becoming" friends without really knowing how it happened.
                  Most users talked about more than one method, but a few said most
                  of their friendships were from someone else befriending them.
                  Some participants talked about making most of their friends through
                  church, school, work, or sports. Most had "friend groups" from
                  several different activities, and a few participants talked about
                  primarily having "one-off" friends who didn't know each other.
                  Although six of the participants had used Bumble BFF,
                  only three said they'd made close friends on the app.

                  Bumble users talked about how it can be easier to make friends
                  on the app than in-person because they know everyone on Bumble BFF
                  is open to making friends. However, all Bumble users
                  talked about feeling unsure if a particular person was interested
                  in being <em>their</em> friend. That feeling was sometimes exacerbated
                  if they got many matches but few messages, and again if they had
                  many conversations but few invites to meet up in person. Most Bumble
                  users reported feeling like they always had to message first and
                  they always had to invite people to meet up, otherwise nothing would ever happen.

                <!-- One participant explained that she couldn't invite people to meet up in person because she
              was new to the city and didn't know what coffee shops were good or what fun events were happening.  -->
                <p>Speaking of activities - while most participants brought up concerns about
                  suggesting an activity, no participants volunteered concerns about
                  what kind of activitiy would work well
                  until they read hypothetical scenarios with specific activities.
                  People began expressing strong opinons about what kinds of activities
                  would be both engaging and leave room for conversation -
                  and not everyone agreed. People were split on whether
                  they'd be interested in meeting other people
                  who spoke the same second language and on whether they'd like to meet
                  people who also liked their favorite cuisine. Most participants agreed
                  that they'd enjoy meeting up for a niche hobby like kayaking, and
                  expressed interest in finding people to do hobbies with, even if they
                  didn't become friends.

              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">How would group meetups be different from 1:1 hangouts?</div>
              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>Several of the participants who were introverted or reported having social anxiety
                  said that ideally they would build friendships exclusively through 1:1s.
                  Other participants wanted to meet in a group setting first, and then meet 1:1.
                  Some preferred to meet 1:1 first, and then meet in group settings,
                  before eventually meeting 1:1 again in order to go from being a friend to a close friend.
                  No matter which camp, people eventually circled back to 1:1s, and
                  several participants articulated that is because people are more
                  vulnerable and grow closer in 1:1 settings; you don't become
                  best friends in a group setting.
                </p>
                <p>Some participants talked about how it can be difficult to build
                  a friend group because people need to meet each other early on,
                  otherwise some people feel closer with others and the friend circle
                  can feel imbalanced. But on the other hand, if you connect people too
                  early, then people feel like they don't have a close friendship
                  because they're spread too thin.
                </p>
                <p>All participants said they'd be more likely to cancel on a
                  group meetup than a 1:1 hangout because a) they wouldn't be inconveniencing anyone
                  because the rest of the group could still meet and b) because larger
                  social events take more energy.</p>
                <p>Some participants were interested in group meetups,
                  half said they would only be interested if they picked all the attendees,
                  and half said they would never be interested in planning a group
                  meetup. Preferences were very split on whether they would be willing
                  to show up and meet strangers, whether seeing profiles ahead of time
                  would be enough, or if they wanted to text in a group or text 1:1
                  before meeting up in person. This, combined with how split people
                  were on what kinds of activities would help them make friends,
                  makes it seem like planning group activities would be a niche market
                  among Bumble users.

                  <b>Finding someone with similar interests: </b>
                  All participants talked about looking for friends who have
                  similar interests - hobbies they do, causes they care about, etc -
                  and how they would like to see that information on people's profiles.
                  Within a month of conducting these interviews, Bumble began A/B
                  testing and then released an app update that allows users to
                  showcase their stage of life (eg, new in town, wedding planning,
                  going back to school, working parent, sober life) and their
                  interests (eg, religion, social activism, sports, music).
                  While I'm sure some people wish there were more categories and
                  subcategories, I think this will be a huge part in helping
                  Bumble users find people with matching hobbies!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Finding someone to click with: </b>
                  Several participants articulated that profiles help them weed out
                  people who they wouldn't be friends with (eg, people they would
                  disagree with too much politically or religiously),
                  but don't help them find someone who they'd would be friends with
                  (eg, someone they "just click with").
                  The dating app Hinge has a
                  <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/hinge-rolls-out-new-we-met-feature/">feature</a>
                  where users are asked a) if you went on a date
                  and b) if your date is the type of person you'd like to see again.
                  A feature like that might help Bumble have more accurate data
                  to give people better matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Help people move beyond texting: </b>
                  All Bumble users talked about feeling like they had to instigate
                  with every person they met on Bumble, and most participants talked
                  about worrying if other people were really interested in being their friend.
                  Bumble might try to help get the ball rolling by having a chat bot asking one or
                  both participants if they're interested in meeting up in person,
                  or jumping in with suggestions to both people in the chat.
                  "Hi Naomi, we noticed you've been chatting with Sarah for about two weeks.
                  Are you interested in meeting them?" If the user selected "Yes",
                  Bumble could suggest a few kinds of activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Group meetups: </b>
                  It seems like there is some interest in group meetup, but there
                  was no consensus on how many people would work, how people should connect before
                  a meetup, and how to help people feel comfortable. At this time,
                  Bumble should focus on making 1:1 meetups feel more natural.

                  <b>Keep moderator's guides short:</b>
                  Because I have no affiliation with Bumble and only my personal
                  experiences as background information, I went into this project blind.
                  My moderator's guide had way more questions than it should have for a
                  60 minute interview, and I did run out of time for the last
                  scenario or two on a few interviews. I easily could have done a
                  full 60 minute interview on any of the three research questions.
                  It's usually better to do quality research than to get a large
                  quantity of feedback, but this time it seemed worthwhile because
                  I needed to get so much background information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Have a budget for research:</b>
                  I wish I could have talked to more people who had never used Bumble, but I talked to
                  the people who were willing to give me an hour of their time. Several
                  participants were people that I met on Bumble, so I asked them to not
                  talk about meeting me in the interview in order to not get biased data -
                  but ideally, I wouldn't be interviewing my friends about friendship.

                  I think talking to people before going to a 1:1 or group activity,
                  observing the activity, and then talking to them
                  individually afterwards would have been much more insightful than
                  just talking to people about the idea of meeting strangers.
                  People are notoriously bad at predicting what they will think or do.
                  Another option could have been a diary study - while there are drawbacks,
                  I would have been able to see how people's impressions and opinions
                  before an activity, see their report, and what they thought afterwards.
                  Ideally, I would love to talk to both people before and after they met
                  to see both sides.
