        <p class="proj-subtitle">
            <b>Problem statement</b>
            Each year, over two million parents in the US use ratings on GreatSchools.org to evaluate K-12 school
            quality - if they misinterpret ratings, they may pick a school they regret. To build users trust, school
            ratings must be easily understandable.

                recurring pain points, and referenced foundational artifacts I had previously created (personas, journey

                All participants' primary question was “what does this rating mean” (what the score represents), and all
                participants felt like the answer to that question should also answer “what data was used” (name of
                test, subject of test, grades of students tested) and “how old the data is” (at a minimum: whether it is
                the newest available data, and ideally also the school year the data is from).
            </p>
            <p>
                For test scores, some wanted to see the average score by grade and/or by subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                For student progress, most wanted to know if the same test was offered twice during one school year
                (although it seems like some participants were asking that because they actually wanted to know if the
                same students were taking the same test twice or not - e.g., what happens with a 5th → 6th grade
                transition. Further research would be needed to understand if the answers to both questions are
                necessary).
            </p>
            <p>
                Although “how should the score should be interpreted” was not an option during the activity, it should
                have been. Many participants misinterpreted rating(s) by reading the rating in the context of their
                student (rather than in the context of how the school is doing in the state). In other words, when
                participants looked at a rating, they were asking themself “What does this rating mean for my child?”
