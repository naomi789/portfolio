						<div class="proj-section-header">The Problem</div>
						<div class="proj-section-content">
							<p>Learning a new language involves looking up new words in a dictionary--- but sometimes students find themselves looking up the same word again and again if they do not learn it. This is particularly difficult for students learning
								Japanese. In addition to understanding the english meaning of a given word, they will need to learn the pronunciation of the word as well as the written kanji. Looking up new words in a dictionary can be challenging because there are
								over 2000 kanji and most dictionaries let you look up the kanji by either the pronunciation or by knowing the stroke order of how the character is written.</p>
							<p>After looking up the word, students need to learn it: but paper flashcards only have two sides, and digital ones often have the same issue. Besides, why should you need to install another app? If you've downloaded a foreign language
								dictionary, you probably intend to learn the words you're looking up.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="proj-section-header">Background Research</div>
						<div class="proj-section-content">
							<p>I began by searching online for “best Japanese dictionary app” and “best Japanese flashcard websites”. After reading several posts, I took notes of names that came up more than once and began surveying existing dictionary websites
								(nihongodict.com and jisho.org) and flashcard websites (quizlet.com). I then looked at Android and iOS apps (A Word, Aedict, Akebi, Anki, Brainscape, Busuu, Cram, English Japanese Dictionary, Flashcards, Flashcards Plus by Chegg, GRE
								Vocabulary by Magoosh, Imiwa?, Lexilize, Jsho, Japanese by Renzo Inc, Rolandos, StudyBlue, StudyStack, EOW, Takoboto, Tinycards, Vocabulary.com, and Waygo), and Microsoft Phone apps (Tango Master).</p>
							<p>For most of these apps, we explored how their search page was before and after a query, whether and how they allowed users to store words, and whether there was any kind of flashcard app. Tango Master and Akebi were the only apps
								that allowed us to query a dictionary and then add that word to a deck of flashcards. Tango Master’s greatest failure is the fact that the app is only available in the Microsoft store. While Akebi does have the ability to create
								flashcards, the interface does not allow users to automatically add results from a query to a deck of flashcards, and the search results page was a dated design.</p>
							<!-- <p>The competitor analysis let us see what features are common in online Japanese/English dictionaries, as well as look for differentiating factors where one app was doing particularly well, or particularly poorly. We decided to combine a flashcard app with dictionary functionality.</p> -->
							<div class="proj-section-header">Ideation & Iteration</div>
							<div class="proj-section-content">
								<p>We anticipated most of our users would be high school or university students enrolled in language classes. Instead of creating user personas, we found ten different students who were either studying Japanese, or native Japanese
									speakers who were learning English, who could participate in interviews and studies. We also interviewed a Japanese language professor in order to gain insight on student language study.</p>
								<!-- 1. Student looks at long vocab list; doesn't want to make paper flashcards (environmental concerns). 2. Uses digital ones online from two years ago, doesn't realize professor changed about 10% of the words for this unit. 3. Makes their own digital ones after struggling to find software that does "triangle" flashcards. 4. Doesn't actually want to study the vocab list bc they think they know most of the words 5. Over-achiver student looks up words they come across while reading a news article online, but forgets to add the word to their study list. -->
								<p>We created a problem scenario storyboard, based on interviews from students, to show what a student's life is like without a dictionary/flashcard app.</p>
								<!-- <div class="carousel">

								<p>We created a list of requirements for our solution.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Search functionality works with English or Japanese writing systems (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji).</li>
									<li>Recent queries should be shown as history, but users should be able to delete words.</li>
									<li>Search results should appear below the search bar. Each row will contain the english word, kanji element, hiragana/katakana, romaji, as well as other information about the word entry. To the right of each row will be a "+"
										button
										for adding the word entry to a new or preexisting list.</li>
									<li>Users must sign up for free accounts before they create a vocab list/flashcard deck.</li>
									<li>Users should be able to use a filter to view a list of all public vocab lists and their private lists. Users should be able to delete their private vocab lists. Clicking a list will bring the user to that list’s page. </li>
									<li>Each list’s page will display the words in that list and an edit button. The edit button allows users to delete words. From this page, users should be able to start going through flashcards for the words in the deck.</li>
									<li>Once users have started their flashcards/quiz, users should be able to see the reverse side of the page with the click of a button, and self-report if they got the answer right.</li>
									<li>There should be a "settings" page for each flashcard deck where users can see how often they have been quized on each word, how often they get the answer correct, and how long it took them to get the right answer. Using this
										data,
										the app should determine which words need to be studied and when.</li>
								</ol>

								<p>We created paper prototypes and ran five 15 minute usability studies where we asked users to look up a word and add it to a flashcard deck. After a few design tweaks, we created clickable wireframes using Balsamiq. After running
									the
									same study again, we upgraded to a functional <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2160138f-f0bb-43da-582e-bb91bdd270b8-5751/">prototype </a> made in AdobeXd.</p>
								<!-- <p> I created user personas, designed user scenarios, created wireframes, and made a functional prototype with AdobeXd. As features became functional on our live site, I designed qualitative user studies, ran them, and analyzed data. Even as we finished the final product, we were gathering data and creating action items that could improve the quality and usability of our site.</p> -->
							</div>
							<div class="proj-section-header">Final Solution</div>
							<div class="proj-section-content">
							<p>I wrote Python scripts that converted the JSON files into MySQL statements, used JavaScript to access the database, and displayed the results in HTML. Our fully functional relational database with nine tables that had a combined
								total of 1.25 million entries, eleven thousand kanji, and tens of thousands of words, some of which had over ten different definitions. My teammates and I got a minimum viable product functioning (signup/login and logout, the
								search/results page, displays for the flashcard decks and flashcards). From there, we started working on the CSS. Our code is available on <a href="https://github.com/naomi789/2019_4640">GitHub</a>. I earned an "A" on this project and
								in this course, as did my three collaborators.</p>
							<p>We were able to complete the first seven of eight requirements. We were not able to complete the eighth requirement on time (a page that shows how often a user has been quized on each word, how often they get the answer correct, and
								how long it took them to get the right answer), but we were able to create backend features to track whether users got flashcards right and how long they spent thinking about it. We have not yet created an algorithm to determine how
								often users should be quizzed on their vocabulary words, how much they should be rewarded for immediately getting an answer correct, or how many times they need to get it right before we can take the word off the rotation for a while.
								We hope to create a front end that will display some of this data, as well as statistics about how many words a user is studying per day.</p>
							<h3>Outcome& Impact</h3>
							<p>We identified key reasons why students failed to learn new vocabulary, then created our website in order to streamline the process by combining dictionary and flashcard functionality and by making vocab lists public so students can
								share them. </p>

							<!-- <p>In addition to writing the code and running the user studies, there are several other features in development.</p> -->
